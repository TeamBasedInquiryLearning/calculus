<div class="introduction"><p>Waterford movie theater currently charges \$8 for a ticket. At this price, the theater sells 200 tickets daily. The general manager wonders if they can generate more revenue by increasing the price of a tickets. A survey shows that they will lose 20 customers for every dollar increase in the ticket price.</p></div>
