                    Suppose a  trapezoidal dam has height {{height}} feet, top width of {{top}} feet and bottom width of {{bottom}} feet.  Water is pressed against the entire surface of the dam. Find an integral which computes the force exerted against this dam. Recall that the pressure of water at depth <m>h</m> feet  is <m>62.4h</m> pounds per square foot.
