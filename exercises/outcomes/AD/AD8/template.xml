            <p>
You've been asked to design a metalic box that is constructed from a
rectangular sheet of metal of size <m>{{length}} \times {{width}}</m> {{units}}<m>^2</m>.
Four equally sized squares must be cut from each corner of the rectangle, so that the remaining
material can be folded and welded into a lidless box. How large should these
squares be to maximize the volume that this box can contain?
            </p>

Suppose you wished to build a gift box from a rectangular sheet
of construction paper that measures <m>{{length}}</m> {{units}} long by
<m>{{width}}</m> {{units}} wide. By cutting identical square pieces from each
corner, the sides can be folded up and taped together, creating a lidless box.
How large should you cut these squares so that the resulting box has maximum volume?

Suppose that if a {{widget}} is priced at <m>\${{base_cost}}</m>, then
you are able to sell <m>{{base_sales}}</m> units each day. According to
a survey of customers, increasing this price by <m>\$1</m> will result
in losing <m>{{change_in_sales}}</m> daily sales; decreasing by <m>\$1</m>
will gain <m>{{change_in_sales}}</m> daily sales.
Your {{person}} asks you how to adjust the price of a {{widget}} to
maximize the revenue ({{widget}}s sold times price). Write an explanation
of what this change in price should be and why.

Suppose that
you are able to sell <m>{{base_sales}}</m> {{widget}}s each week when
priced at <m>\${{base_cost}}</m> per {{widget}}. According to
a survey of customers, decreasing this price by <m>\$1</m> will result
in adding <m>{{change_in_sales}}</m> weekly sales; increasing by <m>\$1</m>
will lose <m>{{change_in_sales}}</m> weekly sales.
Your {{person}} is considering changing the price per {{widget}} to
maximize revenue (units sold times price). Explain what this change
in price should be, and why.

A {{farmer}} currently grows <m>{{base_cost}}</m> {{plant}}s,
which average a yield of <m>{{base_sales}}</m> {{pound}}s of
product from each {{plant}} per year. They could increase or decrease
the number of {{plant}}s grown annually,
but due to crowding the yield for each {{plant}}
would be reduced by <m>{{change_in_sales}}</m> {{pound}}s for each additional
{{plant}}. Explain how the {{farmer}} should change their annual growth
in order to maximize production.

Suppose a {{farmer}} observes that on their land, they are
able to produce <m>{{base_sales}}</m> {{pound}}s of
product from each {{plant}} annually, provided they grow <m>{{base_cost}}</m>
{{plant}}s. But for each additional {{plant}} grown in the limited space,
the harvest for each is lessened by <m>{{change_in_sales}}</m> {{pound}}s.
Assuming the {{farmer}} wants to maximize the amount of product harvested each
year, how should they adjust the number of plants grown?

A {{predator}} is separated from a motionless {{prey}} by a river of width
<m>{{width}}</m> {{units}}, and a length of <m>{{length}}</m> {{units}}
along the river's edge. The {{predator}} is able to run at a speed of
<m>{{land_speed}}</m> {{units}} per second, and swim at a speed of
<m>{{river_speed}}</m> {{units}} per second. How much of the {{predator}}'s
movement should be along the edge of the river in order to minimize the time
required to reach the {{prey}}?

A {{predator}} is distanced from a motionless {{prey}} <m>{{length}}</m>
{{units}} along a stream's edge and <m>{{width}}</m> {{units}} across
the water. The {{predator}} is able to swim at a speed of
<m>{{river_speed}}</m> {{units}} per second, and run at a speed of
<m>{{land_speed}}</m> {{units}} per second. If the {{predator}} wishes
to to minimize the time required to reach the {{prey}}, how much of its 
movement should be along the stream's edge?

A video game speedrunner by the handle {{speedrunner}} wants to minimize
the time it takes to manuever their {{avatar}} down and across a hallway
in order to finish a level as quickly as possible. The length of the hallway
necessary to travel is <m>{{length}}</m> {{pixels}} long,
and the hallway is <m>{{width}}</m> {{pixels}} wide;
the {{avatar}} moves <m>{{land_speed}}</m> {{pixels}} per frame
along the hallway's wall and <m>{{river_speed}}</m> {{pixels}} per frame
across the hallway. How much of {{speedrunner}}'s movement should
be along the wall of the hallway?

A popular streamer named {{speedrunner}} is speedrunning a video game
that includes a rectangular corridor
<m>{{width}}</m> {{pixels}} wide.
Their {{avatar}} moves <m>{{land_speed}}</m> {{pixels}} per frame
along the edge of the corridor and <m>{{river_speed}}</m> {{pixels}} per frame
across it. How should {{speedrunner}} move their {{avatar}} along
the corridor's edge in order to minimize
the time required to move their {{avatar}}
a distance of <m>{{length}}</m> {{pixels}} down the corridor,
from one side of the corridor to the opposite side?
