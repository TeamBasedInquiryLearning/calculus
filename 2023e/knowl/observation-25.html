<div class="para">We've been looking at two big things in this chapter: antiderivatives and the area under a curve. In the early days of the development of calculus, they were not known to be connected to one another. The integral sign wasn't originally used in both instances. (Gottfried Leibniz introduced it as an elongated S to represent the sum when finding the area.) Connecting these two seemingly separate problems is done by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="IN5.html#observation-25" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
