</h4>Many of the equations that has been discussed so far fall under the category of an explicit equation.  An explicit equation is one in which the relationship between <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is given explicitly, such as <span class="process-math">\(y = f(x)\text{.}\)</span>  In this section we will examine when the relationship between <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is given implicity. An implicit equation looks like <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y) = g(x,y)\)</span> where both sides of the equation may depend on both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span></article><span class="incontext"><a href="DF7.html#obs-df-implicit1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
