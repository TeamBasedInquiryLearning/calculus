<li><p>Draw a diagram and introduce variables. First understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables. Constructing a diagram with the variables labeled is almost always an essential first step. Sometimes drawing several diagrams can be especially helpful to get a sense of the situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the quantity to be optimized as well as any key relationships among the variables. Write down equations that involve the variables that have been introduced: one should represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought, and others could show how multiple variables in the problem are interrelated.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized; this may involve using other relationships among variables to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula. For example, in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/activity-ad8-box.html" title="Activity 3.8.1: The box">Activity 3.8.1</a>, we initially found that <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(V = l \times w \times h \text{,}\)</span> but then the additional relationships that <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(l = w = 8 - 2x\)</span> and <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(h=x\)</span> yield <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(V(x) = (8-2x)^2 x\text{,}\)</span> and thus we have written the volume as a function of the single variable <span xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized. Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on. Thinking back to the diagram describing the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and/or minimum of the quantity being optimized. This always involves finding the critical numbers of the function first. Then, depending on the domain, we either construct a first derivative sign chart (for an open or unbounded interval we use the First or Second Derivative Tests) or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers (for a closed, bounded interval and a continuous function we use the Closed Interval Method).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we make certain we have answered the question: what are the optimal points and what optimal values do we obtain at these points?</p></li>
