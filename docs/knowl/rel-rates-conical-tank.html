<div class="introduction"><p>A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone (the cone points downwards) with a base of radius 6 feet and a depth of 8 feet. Suppose that water is being pumped into the tank at a constant instantaneous rate of 4 cubic feet per minute.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<p>Draw a picture of the conical tank, including a sketch of the water level at a point in time when the tank is not yet full. Introduce variables that measure the radius of the water's surface and the water's depth in the tank, and label them on your figure.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<p>Say that <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the radius and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> the depth of the water at a given time, <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> What proportional equation relates the radius and height of the water, and why?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<p>Determine an equation that relates the volume of water in the tank at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> to the depth <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> of the water at that time.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<p>Through differentiation, find an equation that relates the instantaneous rate of change of water volume with respect to time to the instantaneous rate of change of water depth at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h4>
<p>Find the instantaneous rate at which the water level is rising when the water in the tank is 3 feet deep.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h4>
<p>When is the water rising most rapidly?</p>
