<p>Observe that \(s(2) - s(0) = (32 - 32) - (0 - 0) = 0\text{.}\) This means that the ball has zero change in position on the interval \([0,2]\text{.}\) But we already established that on the interval \([0,1]\text{,}\) the ball traveled 16 feet vertically; since the velocity becomes negative on the interval \(1 \lt t \lt 2\text{,}\) there we know the ball's position is decreasing, so it is falling back to earth. The resulting zero change in position means that at \(t = 2\) the ball has returned to the location from which it was tossed. If we view the area between the velocity function and the \(t\)-axis as being negative wherever \(v\) is negative, then we see that the areas of the two triangles involved are opposites, which in some sense results in the “total area” being zero, matching the change in position.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="IN2.html#oCG">in-context</a></span>
