<p>A spherical balloon is being inflated at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second. How fast is the radius of the balloon changing at the instant the balloon's diameter is 12 inches? Is the radius changing more rapidly when <span class="process-math">\(d = 12\)</span> or when <span class="process-math">\(d = 16\text{?}\)</span> Why? <article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<p>Draw several spheres with different radii, and observe that as volume changes, the radius, diameter, and surface area of the balloon also change.</p></article> <article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<p>Recall that the volume of a sphere of radius <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\text{.}\)</span> Note as well that in the setting of this problem, <em class="emphasis">both</em> <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> are changing as time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> changes, and thus both <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> may be viewed as <em class="emphasis">implicit</em> functions of <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> with respective derivatives <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dV}{dt}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dr}{dt}\text{.}\)</span> Differentiate both sides of the equation <span class="process-math">\(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> (using the chain rule on the right) to find a formula for <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dV}{dt}\)</span> that depends on both <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dr}{dt}\text{.}\)</span></p></article> <article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<p>At this point in the problem, by differentiating we have “related the rates” of change of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span> Recall that we are given in the problem that the balloon is being inflated at a constant <em class="emphasis">rate</em> of 20 cubic inches per second. Is this rate the value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dr}{dt}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dV}{dt}\text{?}\)</span> Why?</p></article> <article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<p>From part (c), we know the value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dV}{dt}\)</span> at every value of <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> Next, observe that when the diameter of the balloon is 12, we know the value of the radius. In the equation <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}\text{,}\)</span> substitute these values for the relevant quantities and solve for the remaining unknown quantity, which is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dr}{dt}\text{.}\)</span> How fast is the radius changing at the instant <span class="process-math">\(d = 12\text{?}\)</span></p></article> <article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h4>
<p>How is the situation different when <span class="process-math">\(d = 16\text{?}\)</span> When is the radius changing more rapidly, when <span class="process-math">\(d = 12\)</span> or when <span class="process-math">\(d = 16\text{?}\)</span></p></article></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="AD3.html#rel-rates-spherical-balloon">in-context</a></span>
