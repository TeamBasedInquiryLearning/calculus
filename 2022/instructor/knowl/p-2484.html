<p>``As the crow flies'' is an idiom used to describe the most direct path between two points. The <em class="emphasis">polar coordinate system</em> is a useful parametrization of the plane that, rather than describing horizontal and vertical position relative to the origin in the usual way, describes a point in terms of distance from the origin and direction. The origin is also known as the <em class="emphasis">pole</em> (hence polar coordinates). Let <span class="process-math">\(\overline{OP}\)</span> be a line segment from the origin to a given point <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> in the plane. The length of <span class="process-math">\(\overline{OP}\)</span> is the distance (or <em class="emphasis">radius</em>) <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> from the origin to <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> The <em class="emphasis">polar axis</em> is a ray starting at the origin. To define the "direction" of <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> we form an angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> by letting the polar axis serve as the initial ray and <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{OP}\)</span> as the terminal ray. We will set the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis as the polar axis and assume the movement in the positive direction is counter-clockwise (as in trigonometry). Notice that, unlike in the rectangular (or <em class="emphasis">Cartesian</em>) coordinate system, the polar coordinates <span class="process-math">\((r,\theta)\)</span> for a point are not unique, as we could turn either way to face a given point (or even spin around a number of times before facing that direction). Furthermore, by allowing <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to be negative, we can also "walk backwards" to get to a point by facing in the opposite direction. Rather than the grid lines defined by specific values for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in the rectangular coordinate system, specific values of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> correspond to circles of radius <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> centered about the origin, and specific values of <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> correspond to lines going through the pole (called <em class="emphasis">radial lines</em>).</p>
