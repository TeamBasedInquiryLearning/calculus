<p>So far we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which one variable, say <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> changes with respect to another, say <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> leading us to compute and interpret <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}\)</span> We also have situations where several variables change together and often each quantity is a function of time, represented by the variable <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> Knowing how the quantities are related, we will determine how their rates of change with respect to time are related.</p>
