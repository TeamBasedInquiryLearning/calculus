How fast was he at different instances? What was his maximum velocity?\n                    Let's explore this. The table   shows his split times recorded every 10 meters.  \n                       \n                   \n                       \n                   What was the average velocity on the first 50 meters? On the second 50 meters?  What was the average velocity between 30 and 50 meters? Between 50 and 70 meters?   What was the average velocity between 40 and 50 meters? Between 50 and 60 meters?  What is your best estimate for the Usain's velocity at the instant when he passed the 50 meters mark? This is your estimate for the instantaneous velocity.  Using the table of values, explain why 50 meters is NOT the best guess for when the instantaneous velocity was the largest. What other point would be more reasonable?  "

After 1 second the ball is falling at a speed of 32 meters per second.   After 1 second the ball is moving upwards at a speed of 32 meters per second.   After 1 second the ball reaches its highest point and it stops for an instant.   After 1 second the ball is falling at a speed of 16 meters per second.   After 1 second the ball is moving upwards at a speed of 16 meters per second.  A function can only be differentiable at   if it is also continuous at  .
