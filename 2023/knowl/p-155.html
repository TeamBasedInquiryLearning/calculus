<div class="para">In this activity you will study the velocity of Usain Bolt in his Beijing 100 meters dash. He completed 100 meters in 9.69 seconds for an overall average speed of 100/9.69 = 10.32 meters per second (about 23 miles per hour). But this is the average velocity on the whole interval. How fast was he at different instances? What was his maximum velocity? Let’s explore this. The table <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table-bolt1.html" title="Table 12">Table 12</a> shows his split times recorded every 10 meters.</div>
