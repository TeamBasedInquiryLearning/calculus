<div class="introduction"><div class="para">A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone (the cone points downwards) with a base of radius 6 feet and a depth of 8 feet. Suppose that water is being pumped into the tank at a constant instantaneous rate of 4 cubic feet per minute.</div></div>

<div class="para">Draw a picture of the conical tank, including a sketch of the water level at a point in time when the tank is not yet full. Introduce variables that measure the radius of the water’s surface and the water’s depth in the tank, and label them on your figure.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Say that <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is the radius and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> the depth of the water at a given time, <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> Notice that at any point of time there is a fixed proportion between the depth and the radius of the volume of water, forced by the shape of the tank. What proportional equation relates the radius and height of the water, and why?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
