<div class="para">As seen in the previous activity, having too few terms may prevent us from finding a unique way to continue creating a sequence of numbers. In fact, we need sufficiently many terms to uniquely continue a sequence of numbers (and how many terms is sufficient depends on which sequence of numbers you are trying to generate). Sometimes, we do not want to write out all of the terms needed to allow for this. Therefore, we will want to find short-hand notation that allows us to do so.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="SQ1.html#remark-50" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
