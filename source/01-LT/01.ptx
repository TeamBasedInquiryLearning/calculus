            <p>
            When studying functions in algebra, we often focused on the <em>value</em> of a function given a specific <m>x</m>-value. For instance, finding <m>f(2)</m> for some function <m>f(x)</m>. In calculus, and here in <xref ref="activity-limits-graphically1"/> and <xref ref="activity-limits-graphically2"/>, we have instead been exploring what is happening as we <em>approach</em> a certain value on a graph.  This concept in mathematics is known as finding a limit.
