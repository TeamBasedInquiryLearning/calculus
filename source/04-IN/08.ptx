  <remark>
      <p> In <xref ref="IN7"/>, we learned how to find the area between a curve and the <m>x</m>-axis (<m>f(x)=0</m>) using a definite integral. What if we want the area between any two functions? What if the <m>x</m>-axis is not one of the boundaries?</p>
       
       <p>In this section, we'll investigate how a definite integral may be used to represent the area between two curves.</p>

    <note>
    
    <p> We've seen from <xref ref="act-area-concept"/> that a natural way to think about the area between two curve is as the area beneath the upper curve minus the area beneath the lower curve.</p>

      In each of the following problems,
      our goal is to determine the area of the region described.
      For each region, (i) determine the intersection points of the curves, (ii) sketch the region whose area is being found, (iii) draw and label a representative slice,
      and (iv) state the area of the representative slice.
      Then, state a definite integral whose value is the exact area of the region,
      and evaluate the integral to find the numeric value of the region's area.
