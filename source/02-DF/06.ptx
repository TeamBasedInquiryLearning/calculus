    <remark>
  <p> We've learned a lot of rules to help us take derivatives of functions, and these rules are applied based on the algebraic structure of the function. (Note that we often see that algebraic structure come up in the names of the rules. Sum/difference, power, product, and quotient rules for example!) To take a derivative, we need to examine how the function is built and then proceed accordingly. Up until now we have not seen many situations where these rules were mixed together too much. Now we turn our attention to those types of situations. </p>

<p> Below are some questions you might ask yourself as you take the derivative of a function, especially one where multiple rules might need to be used:
   <ol>
        <li> How is this function built algebraically? What kind of function is this? What is the big picture?</li>
        <li> Where do you start?  </li>
        <li> Is there an easier or more convenient way to write the function?  </li>
        <li> Are there products or quotients involved? </li>
        <li> Is it a composition of two (or more) functions? If so, what are the outside and inside functions? </li>
        <li> What derivatives rules will be needed along the way? </li>
    </ol>
     </p>
