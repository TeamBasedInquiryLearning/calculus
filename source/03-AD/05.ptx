        <p>
         We say that <m>f(x)</m> has a <term>local maximum</term> at <m>x=c</m> provided that <m>f(c)\geq f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> near <m>c</m>. We also say that <m>f(c)</m> is a local maximum value for the function. On the other hand, we say that <m>f(x)</m> has a <term>local minimum</term> at <m>x=c</m> provided that <m>f(c)\leq f(x)</m> for all <m>x</m> near <m>c</m>.  We also say that <m>f(c)</m> is a local minimum value for the function. The local maxima and minima are also known as the <em>local extrema</em> (or relative extrema) of the function.

    <observation xml:id="obs-local-extrema-critical-points">
<p> 
To find the extreme values of a function we can consider all its <em>local extrema</em> (local maxima and minima) and study them to find which one(s) give the largest and smallest values on the function. But how do you find the local/relative extrema?  We will see that we can detect local extrema by computing the first derivative and finding the critical points of the function. By finding the critical points, we will produce a list of candidates for the extrema of the function.
