<remark xml:id = "rmk-intro-related-rates">
    <p>
      So far
      we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which one variable,
      say <m>y</m>, changes with respect to another, say <m>x</m>,
      leading us to compute and interpret <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
      We also have situations where several variables change together and often each quantity is a function of time,
      represented by the variable <m>t</m>.
      Knowing how the quantities are related,
      we will determine how their rates of change with respect to time are related.
    </p>
   </remark>
    
<example xml:id = "eg-related-rates-chain"> <p>In a sense, the chain rule is our first example of related rates: 
recall that when <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>, which in turn is a function of <m>t</m>, we are considering the composite function <m>y(x(t))</m>, and we learned that by the chain rule </p>
<me>\frac{d y}{d t} = \frac{d y}{d x} \cdot \frac{d x}{d t} </me>
<p>Notice that the chain rule gives a relationship between three rates: <m>\frac{d y}{d t} , \frac{d y}{d x},  \frac{d x}{d t}</m>.</p>

<example xml:id = "eg-related-rates-baloon">    
    <p>
      In a more serious example,
      suppose that air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second.
      Since the balloon's volume and radius are related,
      by knowing how fast the volume is changing,
      we ought to be able to discover how fast the radius is changing.
      Can we determine how fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the balloon's diameter is 12 inches?
    </p>
 </example>

<activity xml:id="rel-rates-spherical-balloon">
  <p>
    A spherical balloon is being inflated at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second.
    How fast is the radius of the balloon changing at the instant the balloon's diameter is 12 inches?
    Is the radius changing more rapidly when <m>d = 12</m> or when <m>d = 16</m>?
    Why?

   
     <task>
        <p>
          Draw several spheres with different radii,
          and observe that as volume changes, the radius,
          diameter, and surface area of the balloon also change.
        </p>
      </task>

     <task>
        <p>
          Recall that the volume of a sphere of radius <m>r</m> is <m>V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m>.
          Note as well that in the setting of this problem,
          <em>both</em> <m>V</m> <em>and </em> <m>r</m> are changing with time <m>t</m>.
          Hence both <m>V</m> and <m>r</m> may be viewed as <em>implicit</em> functions of <m>t</m>,
          with respective derivatives
          <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> and <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.
          Differentiate both sides of the equation
          <m>V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3</m> with respect to <m>t</m>
          (using the chain rule on the right)
          to find a formula for
          <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> that depends on both <m>r</m> and <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.
        </p>
      </task>

     <task>
        <p>
          At this point in the problem,
          by differentiating we have
          <q>related the rates</q>
          of change of <m>V</m> and <m>r</m>.
          Recall that we are given in the problem that the balloon is being inflated at a constant <em>rate</em>
          of 20 cubic inches per second.
          Is this rate the value of
          <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m> or <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m>?
          Why?
        </p>
      </task>

     <task>
        <p>
          From part (c), we know the value of
          <m>\frac{dV}{dt}</m> at every value of <m>t</m>.
          Next,
          observe that when the diameter of the balloon is 12,
          we know the value of the radius.
          In the equation <m>\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}</m>,
          substitute these values for the relevant quantities and solve for the remaining unknown quantity,
          which is <m>\frac{dr}{dt}</m>.
          How fast is the radius changing at the instant <m>d = 12</m>?
        </p>
      </task>

     <task>
        <p>
          How is the situation different when <m>d = 16</m>?
          When is the radius changing more rapidly,
          when <m>d = 12</m> or when <m>d = 16</m>?

      In problems where two or more quantities are related to one another,
