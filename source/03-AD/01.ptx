    <introduction><p>The manager of a computer shop has to decide how many computers to store in the back of the shop. If she stores a large number, she has to pay
extra in storage costs. If she stores only a small number, she will have to reorder
more often, which will involve additional handling costs. She has found that if she
stores <m>x</m> computers, the storage and handling costs will
be <m>C</m> dollars, where

    <introduction>
    <p> Consider a cup of coffee initially at <m> 100^\circ</m>F. The said cup of coffee was forgotten this morning in my living room where the thermostat is set at <m>72^\circ</m>F. I also observed that when I initially prepared the coffee, the temperature was decreasing at a rate of <m>3.8</m> degrees per minute.
        </p></introduction>
    <task>
        <p> In the long run, what temperature do you expect the coffee to tend to? Use this information in the model <m>y=ae^{-kt}t+c</m> to determine the value of <m>c</m>.
            </p></task>
    <task>
        <p> Using the initial temperature of the coffee and your value of <m>c</m>, find the value of <m>a</m> in the model <m>y=ae^{-kt}t+c</m>.
            </p></task>
     <task>
        <p> The scenario also gives you information about the value of the rate of change at <m>t=0</m>. Use this additional information to determine the model <m>y=ae^{-kt}t+c</m> completely.
            </p></task>
     <task>
        <p>  You should find that the temperature model for this coffee cup is <m>y= 72 + 38 e^{-0.1t}</m>. Explain how the values of each parameter connects to the information given.
